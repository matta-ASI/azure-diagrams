Overview of the Solution
The solution is divided into several key components, each playing a crucial role in the overall functionality of the system. These components include:
Data Integration & Storage: This component is responsible for ingesting data from various sources and storing it in a centralized location. It comprises Data Factory, Data Lake, and Monitor Dashboard.
Application Databases: This component includes Cosmos DB and SQL Database, which serve as the primary data repositories for the solution.
Search & Analytics: This component enables users to search and analyze data using Power BI and Cognitive Search.
Access & Security: This component ensures secure access to the solution through Active Directory, Rule-Based Access Control, and Auditing/Logging.
Data Flow and Interactions
The diagram illustrates the flow of data between these components, highlighting the interactions and dependencies between them. For instance:
Data Factory extracts data from Application Databases and loads it into Data Lake.
Cognitive Search indexes data from Data Lake, enabling efficient search capabilities.
Power BI retrieves data from Cognitive Search and provides analytics and insights.
Power Apps interacts with Cognitive Search to facilitate user input and search queries.
Active Directory authenticates users and enforces access controls through Rule-Based Access Control.
Monitoring and Logging
